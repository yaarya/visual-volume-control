# visual-volume-control
This repository contains a gesture-based Hand Tracking and Volume Control System using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The project is divided into multiple stages, including building a hand tracking module, testing coordinates of hand landmarks, detecting the number of fingers raised, and developing a gesture-controlled volume adjustment system.
